#About Me

##I'm Christin MP, a passionate and driven first-year Computer Science and Engineering student at Wayanad Government Engineering College. With a strong foundation in programming languages like Python and C++, I am actively building skills in web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), algorithms, and data structures to enhance my software engineering expertise.

##I'm highly interested in ethical hacking, particularly in exploring cybersecurity tools like Kali Linux, and I'm expanding my knowledge in automation, web scraping (Beautiful Soup), and PDF manipulation with Python. I also enjoy working on algorithmic challenges, seeking to write efficient and clean code.
Beyond coding, I aspire to become an entrepreneur, combining technical skills with innovative business ideas. Iâ€™m keen on learning graphic design, understanding the market, and discovering ways to creatively leverage my talents.

##Currently, I'm focused on building a strong portfolio, exploring internship opportunities, and preparing for a future in software engineering. I aim to work with top companies, apply my knowledge to real-world problems, and eventually create impactful solutions as a tech entrepreneur.
